# Mathematical-Roadmap-for-Machine-Learning

Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing well. Knowing the mathematics behind Machine Learning algorithms is a superpower. If you have ever built a model for a real-life problem, you probably experienced that being familiar with the details can go a long way if you want to move beyond baseline performance. This is especially true when you want to push the boundaries of the state of art. 

However, most of the knowledge used in the Machine Learning model is hidden layers of advanced mathematics. Understanding methods used in Machine Learning algorithms might seem difficult since it is built on the top of Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Probability theory. 

Mathematics for Machine Learning covers the field of Statistics, Probability, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Maths, Optimization. These are the major ones required to give any beginner a kickstart.

I have followed this roadmap during my post-grad Data Science course and it has benefitted me immensely to prepare for the ML interviews.
